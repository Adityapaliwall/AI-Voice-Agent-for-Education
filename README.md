🌐 Deployment Guide

1. Deploying the Frontend (Vercel)

We recommend Vercel for hosting Next.js apps.

Push your code to GitHub.

Go to Vercel and import your repository.

Important: In Vercel's "Environment Variables" section, add the keys from your .env.local file (AssemblyAI Key, Clerk Keys, Convex URL).

Click Deploy.

2. Deploying the Backend (Convex)

To make your database live for production:

npx convex deploy

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
